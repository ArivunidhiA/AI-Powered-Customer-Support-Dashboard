# AI-Powered Customer Support Dashboard

## Overview
This project implements an AI-driven customer support dashboard that analyzes support tickets, predicts issue resolution times, and provides insights for improving customer support efficiency. Built using real GitHub issues data as a proxy for support tickets, this tool demonstrates practical application of machine learning in customer service automation.

## Features
- 🤖 ML-powered ticket classification and resolution time prediction
- 📊 Real-time metrics tracking and visualization
- 🔍 Identification of common support issues
- ⏱️ Resolution time analysis and optimization
- 💾 SQLite database for efficient data storage and retrieval

## Key Metrics Tracked
- Average ticket resolution time
- Ticket resolution rate
- Common issue patterns
- Support team performance indicators
- Ticket volume trends

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn for machine learning
- pandas for data processing
- SQLite for data storage
- GitHub Issues dataset for real support ticket data
